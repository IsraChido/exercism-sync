### Solutions and code iterations from the [Exercism.org](https://exercism.org) platform.

## About This Repository

Welcome\! This repository serves as a personal backup of the solutions and code iterations I've made while studying and practicing on Exercism. It's a living journal of my progress, allowing me to look back on how my problem-solving skills and coding style evolve over time.

This isn't just about the final "correct" answer, but also about the steps taken to get there.

## ðŸš€ Current Focus: Go

I am currently working my way through the **Go track**. You'll find my most recent work inside the `/go` directory. I'm focusing on writing clean, idiomatic Go and deepening my understanding of its core concepts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by language, with each exercise in its own sub-directory.

```
.
â””â”€â”€ go/
    â”œâ”€â”€ hello-world/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ hello_world.go
    â”œâ”€â”€ two-fer/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ two_fer.go
    â””â”€â”€ ... (more exercises)
```

Feel free to look around, but please remember the goal of Exercism is to learn by doing\!
